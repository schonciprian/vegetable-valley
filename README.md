# Vegetable Valley

This is a frontend application in React using the OpenWeatherMap API.

My name is Ciprian and I love spending time in the garden while I am listening to the chirping of birds or the noise of the wind. 
I started gardening back in my childhood during summer breaks in my grandparents' garden with my own small plot. 
During the 2020's quarantine I have started to plant some vegetables in a small garden. 

In this project you can find some description about vegetables on how to plant or how to take care of them. 
To plan your tasks you can check for the weather forecast too.
