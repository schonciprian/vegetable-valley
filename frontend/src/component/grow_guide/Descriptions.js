        basic_information: 'Garlic is a perennial and is part of the onion family. ' +
            'Garlic grows best in a full sun location in soils that are well-drained and high in organic matter. ' +
            'Garlic is often mentioned as a superfood. ' +
            'Some studies show that it may be effective against high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cholesterol, colds and some cancers. ' +
            'Although these studies point to possible health benefits, you would have to consume a lot to get the desired effects. ' +
            'That should not stop you growing and eating it. ' +
            'Even without those benefits it adds an lovely strong flavour, which can replace salt in many dishes. ' +
            'Even if the actual health effects are minimal Garlic is a great vegetable to add to your garden and diet.',
        how_to_grow: 'Garlic grows best in a sunny fertile spot. Separate a head/bulb of garlic into individual cloves. ' +
            'It is best to get garlic bulbs from a supplier that sells them for growing. ' +
            'It is possible to use the regular garlic cloves that you buy in the shop, but there is a greater risk of disease. ' +
            'Once separated plant the individual cloves about 5 cm deep (pointy end up) every 15 cm in rows 30 cm apart. ' +
            'Avoid pushing the clove into the soil, instead make a hole with finger (or stick) and drop the clove in. ' +
            'Keep the area free from weeds as yields will suffer if they are competing for light. ' +
            'Also remove any flowering heads as they appear. ' +
            'Garlic needs little watering, but yields will improve if watered during very dry periods. ' +
            'Don\'t water formed bulbs as that can encourage rot.',
        how_to_harvest: 'Once the leaves turn yellow in the summer, lift the bulbs and allow to dry under cover.',
