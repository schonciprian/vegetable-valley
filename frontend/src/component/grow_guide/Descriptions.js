        basic_information: 'Garlic is a perennial and is part of the onion family. ' +
            'Garlic grows best in a full sun location in soils that are well-drained and high in organic matter. ' +
            'Garlic is often mentioned as a superfood. ' +
            'Some studies show that it may be effective against high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cholesterol, colds and some cancers. ' +
            'Although these studies point to possible health benefits, you would have to consume a lot to get the desired effects. ' +
            'That should not stop you growing and eating it. ' +
            'Even without those benefits it adds an lovely strong flavour, which can replace salt in many dishes. ' +
            'Even if the actual health effects are minimal Garlic is a great vegetable to add to your garden and diet.',
        how_to_grow: 'Garlic grows best in a sunny fertile spot. Separate a head/bulb of garlic into individual cloves. ' +
            'It is best to get garlic bulbs from a supplier that sells them for growing. ' +
            'It is possible to use the regular garlic cloves that you buy in the shop, but there is a greater risk of disease. ' +
            'Once separated plant the individual cloves about 5 cm deep (pointy end up) every 15 cm in rows 30 cm apart. ' +
            'Avoid pushing the clove into the soil, instead make a hole with finger (or stick) and drop the clove in. ' +
            'Keep the area free from weeds as yields will suffer if they are competing for light. ' +
            'Also remove any flowering heads as they appear. ' +
            'Garlic needs little watering, but yields will improve if watered during very dry periods. ' +
            'Don\'t water formed bulbs as that can encourage rot.',
        how_to_harvest: 'Once the leaves turn yellow in the summer, lift the bulbs and allow to dry under cover.',

            'If growing from seed sow from February through to April in drills 1cm deep and 20cm between rows, sow the seed very thinly. ' +
            'Thin the plants to 5cm apart and later increase to 10cm apart (make sure your hoe can go between rows ' +
            'with plenty of room for the bulbs to grow), you can use the thinning to fill additional rows, water well after transplanting. ' +
            'If growing from sets plant out in March 10cm apart in rows 20cm apart. ' +
            'Push the sets into the soil so that the tip of the set is visible. Weed regularly between rows to control weeds.',
        how_to_harvest: 'When the onion leaves start to turn yellow and fall over, leave for a couple of weeks. ' +
